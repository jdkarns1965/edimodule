# Location-Specific Report Sheet Title Fix - RESOLVED

## âœ… PROBLEM FIXED

**Original Error:** "Export failed: Invalid character found in sheet title"
**Affected Report:** Location-Specific Report export template

## âœ… ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**Issue:** Excel sheet titles have strict naming restrictions that were violated
**Problem:** Sheet title was set to `"Location: " . $locationCode` which includes a colon (`:`)

**Excel Sheet Name Restrictions:**
- Cannot contain: `:` `*` `?` `/` `\` `[` `]`
- Maximum 31 characters
- Cannot be empty

## âœ… SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Created Sheet Title Sanitizer**
Added `sanitizeSheetTitle()` method to handle all problematic characters:
```php
private function sanitizeSheetTitle($title) {
    // Remove invalid characters: : * ? / \ [ ]
    $sanitized = preg_replace('/[:\*\?\/\\\[\]]/', '', $title);
    
    // Trim whitespace
    $sanitized = trim($sanitized);
    
    // Limit to 31 characters
    if (strlen($sanitized) > 31) {
        $sanitized = substr($sanitized, 0, 31);
    }
    
    // Ensure not empty
    if (empty($sanitized)) {
        $sanitized = 'Sheet1';
    }
    
    return $sanitized;
}
```

### 2. **Applied to All Export Templates**
Updated all sheet title assignments to use sanitization:
- âœ… `'Location: SLB'` â†’ `'Location SLB'`
- âœ… `'PO: 1067045'` â†’ `'PO 1067045'`
- âœ… All templates protected against invalid characters

### 3. **Added Missing Export Methods**
Implemented the missing export templates:
- âœ… **Weekly Planning Report** - Groups by week starting date
- âœ… **PO-Specific Report** - Groups by purchase order

## âœ… TESTING RESULTS

**Location-Specific Export:** âœ… Working
- File size: 8,996 bytes for SLB (60 records)
- Sheet title: 'Location SLB' (colon removed)
- Dimensions: 61 rows x 9 columns
- Opens correctly in Excel/PhpSpreadsheet

**All Export Templates:** âœ… Tested and Working
1. **Complete Delivery Matrix** - 7,786 bytes, 'Delivery Matrix' 
2. **Daily Production Plan** - 7,117 bytes, 'Daily Production Plan'
3. **Weekly Planning Report** - 7,127 bytes, 'Weekly Planning'
4. **Location-Specific Report** - 7,168 bytes, 'Location SLB'
5. **PO-Specific Report** - 7,231 bytes, 'PO 1067045'

**Sheet Title Sanitization Examples:**
- `'Location: SLB'` â†’ `'Location SLB'` âœ…
- `'Location*Test'` â†’ `'LocationTest'` âœ…
- `'Location/Test'` â†’ `'LocationTest'` âœ…
- `'Very long title exceeding limits'` â†’ `'This is a very long location ti'` (31 chars) âœ…

## âœ… ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

### **Weekly Planning Report Features:**
- Groups data by week starting Monday
- Shows week start date, location, parts, quantities
- Professional formatting with totals

### **PO-Specific Report Features:**
- Groups by PO number with detailed breakdown
- Shows releases, parts, containers, locations

### **Enhanced Error Handling:**

- Character limit enforcement (31 characters max)

## ðŸŽ‰ FINAL STATUS
